# This `just_return_it` function has:

# * A name: `just_return_it` that we can use to call it

# * A parameter: `num` that it takes as input. You might
#   also hear these informally referred to as 'arguments'

# * A body: `return num` that processes the input and
#   returns the result as output. Python uses spaces at the
#   start of each line to indicate what's the body and what
#   isn't
